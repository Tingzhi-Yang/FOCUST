# FOCUST
# Overview
FOCUST, which stands for Foodborne Colony Semi-supervised Temporal Detection, is a semi-supervised visualization system used for training and detecting colonies. Based on the analysis of colony growth time series data, it provides morphological recognition and classification of colonies, and is dedicated to the detection of foodborne pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella, to alleviate food safety issues.
FOCUST consists of two major sections: the Colonyscope unsupervised detection algorithm, and the ColonyIde single-colony classification model based on a dual-path architecture constructed with liquid neural networks. By connecting multiple models in series, it accurately differentiates dynamic colonies from static food residues, achieving semi-supervised detection and fully automatic colony labeling effects for colony recognition and classification.
With the help of this tool, the high-quality colony growth time series image dataset we have built can be provided in two formats: target detection and single colony, and includes two culture methods: pouring method and coating method. It covers two major types: pure culture and food contamination culture.

FOCUST，意为食源性菌落半监督时序检测，是一种用于训练和检测菌落的半监督可视化系统，基于对菌落生长时间序列数据的分析，提供菌落的形态识别和分类，致力于食源性致病菌检测，如金黄色葡萄球菌、大肠杆菌及沙门氏菌等，减缓食品安全问题。
FOCUST包含两大板块，Colonyscope无监督检测算法以及基于液态神经网络搭建的双路径架构的ColonyIde单菌落分类模型，通过多模型串联实现动态菌落和静态食物残渣的精准区分，达到菌落识别和分类的半监督检测及全自动菌落标注效果。
借助该工具，我们搭建的高质量菌落生长时序图像数据集，可提供目标检测和单菌落两种格式，包含倾注法、涂布法两种培养方式，涵盖纯培养、食品污染培养两大类型。
